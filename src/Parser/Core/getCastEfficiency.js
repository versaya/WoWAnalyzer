Instead of adding a static buffer, this is more dynamic in that if you had 90% of the cooldown time to cast it you probably could have found a good moment, while if you only had 10% of the time then it isn't as likely there was a good opportunity. By making this based on the cooldown time, this scales with the strength of the cooldown; a 1.5 min cooldown is weaker than a 3 min cooldown.
